It failed on deploying, error message:

Diagnosis: The build failure is due to the error message stating that the deploy directory 'build' does not exist, as seen in line 143.

Solution:

Verify that the build directory exists in the root of your project repository.
If the build directory is missing, you need to make sure it is being generated during the build process.
Update the publish directory path in the Netlify configuration to point to the correct location where the site is generated.
Adjust the publish directory path in the Netlify configuration to match the actual build output directory. This is typically where the static files are placed after the build process.
After making sure the build directory is correctly generated and updating the publish path, trigger a new build to deploy the site successfully.
